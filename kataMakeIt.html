      Will you make it?<br />
      <br />
      You were camping with your friends far away from home, but when it's time
      to go back, <br />
      you realize that your fuel is running out and the nearest pump is 50 miles
      away! You <br />
      know that on average, your car runs on about 25 miles per gallon. There
      are 2 gallons <br />
      left. Considering these factors, write a function that tells you if it is
      possible to <br />
      get to the pump or not. Function should return true (1 in Prolog) if it is
      possible and <br />
      false (0 in Prolog) if not. The input values are always positive.<br />
